This directory contains my personal practices using C program.
1. The file grade.c provides users with their grades based on input using if statements.
2. The file grade2.c uses switch statements to print out grades to users based on the score entered.
3. The file bmi.c contains a C program that calculates the body mass index based on the height and weight entered by the user.
